Using React and Yelp API, I've created a Yelp-like web app to search for restaurant listings by location or zip codes.


###### To install locally, run the app in development mode and open it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser:

* Clone the repo
* In Terminal, run: _npm install_
* In the project directory, run: _npm start_



###### To add an YELP API KEY into the src/util/Yelp.js file, navigate before to the “Manage App” section of the [documentation page](https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fv3%2Fmanage_app): note that you’ll have to log in, or create an account if you don’t already have one.

###### If the web app doesn't work, to temporarily unlock access to the demo, click on the button on the following link: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo.
